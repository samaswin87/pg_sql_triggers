  - Added `preload_triggers` method for batch loading triggers into cache
  - Cache is automatically populated during registration and can be manually cleared
  - Significantly reduces database queries when multiple trigger files are loaded during request processing

### Added
- Safety validation for trigger migrations (prevents unsafe DROP + CREATE operations)
  - `Migrator::SafetyValidator` class that detects unsafe DROP + CREATE patterns in migrations
  - Blocks migrations that would drop existing database objects (triggers/functions) and recreate them without validation
  - Only flags as unsafe if the object actually exists in the database
  - Configuration option `allow_unsafe_migrations` (default: false) for global override
  - Environment variable `ALLOW_UNSAFE_MIGRATIONS=true` for per-migration override
  - Provides clear error messages explaining unsafe operations and how to proceed if override is needed
  - New error class `PgSqlTriggers::UnsafeMigrationError` for safety validation failures

  - `Migrator::PreApplyDiffReporter` class for formatting comparison results into human-readable diff reports
  - Automatic pre-apply comparison before executing migrations to show what will change
  - Comparison reports show new objects (will be created), modified objects (will be overwritten), and unchanged objects
  - Detailed diff output for functions and triggers including expected vs actual SQL
  - Summary output in verbose mode or when called from console
  - Non-blocking: shows differences but doesn't prevent migration execution (warns only)
- Complete drift detection system implementation
  - `Drift::Detector` class with all 6 drift states (IN_SYNC, DRIFTED, DISABLED, DROPPED, UNKNOWN, MANUAL_OVERRIDE)
  - `Drift::Reporter` class for formatting drift reports and summaries
  - `Drift::DbQueries` helper module for PostgreSQL system catalog queries

  - Comprehensive test coverage for all drift detection components (>90% coverage)

### Added

  - Added extensive test cases for `Generator::Service` covering all edge cases:
    - Function name quoting (special characters vs simple patterns)
    - Multiple environments handling
    - Condition escaping with quotes
    - Single and multiple event combinations
    - All event types (insert, update, delete, truncate)
    - Blank events and environments filtering
    - Migration number generation edge cases (no existing migrations, timestamp collisions, multiple migrations)
    - Standalone gem context (without Rails)
    - Error handling and logging
    - Checksum calculation with nil values
  - Added test coverage for generator classes:
    - `TriggerMigrationGenerator` - migration number generation, file naming, template usage

  - Implemented session-based storage to maintain form state across page navigation
  - All form fields are restored when returning to edit page: trigger_name, table_name, function_name, function_body, events, version, enabled, timing, condition, and environments
  - Session data is automatically cleared after successful trigger creation
  - Comprehensive test coverage added for session persistence functionality
- Fixed checksum calculation consistency across all code paths (field-concatenation algorithm)
- Fixed `Registry::Manager.diff` method to use drift detection
- Fixed dashboard controller to display actual drifted trigger count
- Fixed SQL parameter handling in `DbQueries.execute_query` method
- Fixed generator service to properly handle function body whitespace stripping
